m.wildwoods_start=\u60c5\u62a5\u7279\u5de5\u514b\u62c9 here, we've detected a recon module left by the Alpha Squad somewhere within this forest.  It is your mission to locate and retrieve the module. \n\nThis forest is home to packs of wild beasts that have proven deadly for squads in the past. Because of this, Tech Knights have placed Beast Bells throughout the area.  Striking them should stun any beasts caught within the sound wave they produce. \n\nBe advised that Recon Knights have reported the presence of a terrible beast the likes which we have not seen before stalking this forest.  Known as 'the Snarbolax,' it appears as a shadowy mass of fangs and claws and seems completely immune to our weaponry.  Should you encounter it, try and find a means of escape as fast as possible. \n\nGood luck!

m.firestorm_start=\u60c5\u62a5\u7279\u5de5\u514b\u62c9 here, at your current depth establishing communications is difficult- I hope you receive this message.  You currently stand in the Firestorm Citadel, some kind of ancient fortress that this planet apparently like to collect.  It is an incredibly hostile region of the Clockworks, you will not last long without the right gear and a talented squad. \n\nWe have detected a faint signal that indicates some kind of artifact of the Alpha Squad's expedition is located within the throne room of this citadel.  We need you to recover this artifact- it could be a valuable clue for discovering their current whereabouts. \n\nI won't lie to you, no squad that has taken this mission has managed to return from the citadel.  As you have no doubt seen, the place burns with an unnatural fire and a legion of similarly unnatural horrors roam every hall.  Now may be a good time to turn back and craft some fire-resistant gear.  A trial by fire will only get you burned. \n\nGood luck!

m.ironclaw_start=\u60c5\u62a5\u7279\u5de5\u514b\u62c9 here, we have intercepted gremlin transmissions from this facility that indicate they are building some kind of weapon to destroy Haven!  It is your mission to infiltrate the facility, destroy this weapon and save Haven from destruction! \n\nKnown only as 'Project Roarmulus,' it is said to be impenetrable from standard attacks.  You will have to find a way to break whatever armor it is using.  Intel suggests this weapon is located deep within the facility. \n\nBut getting to it won't be easy.  You will find that gremlins have little care for a safe work environment as live rockets seem to be fired every which way at all times.  However you should be able to utilize the 'polarity walls' you will find in testing environments to block the oncoming rockets.  Look for a purple and gold switch to toggle them. \n\nWe've also detected another Recon Module of the Alpha Squad somewhere in this factory.  Retrieve it if you can! \n\nGood luck!

m.tf2_start=G'Day, loyal customer! \n\nYou may have recently heard that I've become the fourth richest man in America, having surpassed the fifth richest man in wealth, and having killed the previously-fourth richest man in a harpoon duel. While this is, of course, entirely true (especially the part about the harpoon duel, which was long and bloody), it's not nearly enough. Fourth place might be fine for HIPPIES who wouldn't know victory if it wandered up and offered to braid their ponytails, but it's damn well not good enough for Saxton Hale! \n\n\u6c14\u6001er Reddy, my accountant, explained to me that the best way to light a fire under the backside of Mann Co.'s revenue would be to "open up new markets". I'd relate exactly how we plan on doing that to you, but as he was talking I immediately started doing military presses to keep from dying of boredom, and missed out on the intricate details. \n\nAll you need to know, dear customer, is that I need a good man to find his way to a town called "Haven", bravely stride into one of the many gates there and then cut his way down to the first "Clockworks Terminal". Since we couldn't find a good man, you'll have to do it yourself. You'll be amply rewarded, of course: there's NOTHING I wouldn't do for an employee who risked life and limb on a trivial task necessitated by my selfish whims. \n\nDon't bother directly contacting me once you're done, as I'll be too busy kickboxing giraffes to care. One of my other employees will handle things from there. Best of luck: you'll need it! \n\nSincerely yours, \n\nSAXTON HALE \nAustralian \nCEO, Mann Co.

m.royal_start=\u60c5\u62a5\u7279\u5de5\u514b\u62c9 here, we've detected another Recon Module of the Alpha Squad within this palace.  It is your mission to locate and retrieve the module. \n\nThe Royal Jelly Palace is a strange place.  It appears to be some sort of castle that slimes have re-purposed as a residence for members of their oozing aristocracy.  Known as a 'Royal Jelly,' these noble slimes are said to rule over their countless loyal subjects with an iron fist-shaped appendage. \n\nOur intel suggests that the module is located somewhere near an enormous concentration of slimes, so it is reasonable to believe that it may be the 'throne room' of a Royal Jelly.  If so, be prepared for a fearsome fight- Royal Jellies are quick to anger and love to throw their enormous weight around.  Your best bet is to find a way to suppress their natural regenerative abilities. \n\nGood luck!
