m.design_info=Design Mode allows a guild member of sufficient rank to rearrange the furniture and other infrastructure within a Guild Hall. Once in Design Mode, furniture items can be picked up and put back down again much like a Gold Key or Heavy Statue, and by default they can be rotated while held by using the Mouse Wheel. When you are happy with your rearranging, you can Publish your changes from the Command Console and make them visible to the rest of your guild.
m.emporium_info=The Birdsong Emporium allows high-ranking guild members to purchase items for the guild using funds from the Guild Treasury. These items include various Guild Hall furniture items and upgrades. Purchased items go directly into the Guild Treasury, and thus cannot ever be removed from the guild.\n Furniture comes in a variety of types and sizes and is used to decorate your Guild Hall's rooms and halls to make them feel more like home. Some furniture even has special effects when activated! Any furniture currently in your Guild Treasury can be placed into the Guild Hall using Design Mode.\n The Birdsong Emporium is also where you purchase Guild Upgrades that enhance your guild's capabilities, such as by increasing its maximum member count.\n As a Guild Hall's size increases by adding expansions, the selection of items available in the Birdsong Emporium's catalog also increases. Be sure to check back often to see what's available!
m.guild_hall_info=The Guild Hall is the nerve center for any Spiral Knights guild. Here, guild members can relax, plan future missions, and take advantage of the various Guild Hall amenities at their disposal. The Guild Hall is extremely customizable, and can be expanded to fit guilds of all sizes. It can also contain a wide variety of unique furniture and room types, so coordinate with your friends to make your Guild Hall a true reflection of your guild!\n When a Guild Hall is first opened, it consists of two rooms: a lobby, and the Command Console room. Guilds wishing for more space to customize can purchase expansions to increase the base size of their guild hall. These are available from the Command Console while in Design Mode.\n Guilds that have expanded the usable space in their Hall can fill that space with a variety of different rooms, available for purchase from the Birdsong Emporium. These rooms can be as simple as an empty room for placing furniture, or they can contain one of a number of different guild amenities, such as alchemy terminals, shops and more!\n Guild Halls require a large amount of resources to maintain, which is represented by a weekly upkeep cost in Crowns. As a Guild Hall gains more expansions, this cost increases, so make sure there's enough Crowns in your Guild Treasury to pay for everything!
m.record_info=The Guild Record logs important recent activity within the guild, such as donations to the Guild Treasury, deposits to and withdrawals from the various Guild Storages, and promotions, additions or departures of guild members. They allow higher-ranked guild members to track who is donating or taking a lot from the guild, and act accordingly.
m.storage_info=The Guild Storage acts like a community item bank. Guild members of the appropriate rank can add or remove equipment or items to the Storage as they see fit. It's a great way to share resources between guildmates, or to help out newer members!\n WARNING: Items placed in Guild Storage can be removed and claimed by any guild member with access to Guild Storage. Do not put items into Guild Storage that you want to keep for yourself!
m.treasury_info=The Guild Treasury contains all the items and crowns collectively owned by the guild. In order to be placed within a Guild Hall, furniture must first be added to the Treasury. The costs of new rooms, items from the Birdsong Emporium and weekly upkeep are also paid from the Treasury, so guild members will have to be certain to keep the Guild Treasury full of crowns!\n WARNING: Anything added to the Guild Treasury can never be removed by any member of the guild, including the guild master. By adding items or crowns to the Guild Treasury, they forever become property of the guild. There are no exceptions.
